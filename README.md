# werkstattpy

This Repository is my attempt to solve an issue, which probably annoys many people. Every now and then with an update or upgrade you have to get used to a completly new UI and Workflow. So this thing is going to be written in python and. Python is available for most plattforms and thus is THE weapon of choice. The Idea is to have an Interface you can adjust completly to your needs and extend in its functionality. From the first moment on i knew i wanted it to be modular and flexible. My first thought on a solution was to create this as something like "Webmin" - a http server to provice access to the underlying operating system. I do not intend to reenvent the wheel. But the wheel certainly needs a new layer to make it roll smoother on any surface. That beeing said, you know what it is about. The Name "werksattpy" is mix of "Werkstatt" (the german word f√ºr workshop) and "PYthon". 
It is a fitting name, since it resembles the DIY philosophie with hands on work, the creativity and that things will be customizable and fixable. Plus it gives a good indicator for a naming_scheme of the scripts which will be part of this. Like "Door" for a point of entry or "wrench" for a compressing tool or "Toolbox" for a specic task or workflow, where "Toolbox DEV" could be a Subset of all tools in a folder, which are related to Developing Applications. 

I dont know where this will lead, but 

LETS ROCK!
