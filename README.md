# werkstattpy

This Repository is my attempt to solve an issue, which probably annoys many people. Every now and then with an update or upgrade you have to get used to a completly new UI and Workflow. So this thing is going to be written in python and. Python is available for most plattforms and thus is THE weapon of choice. The Idea is to have an Interface you can adjust completly to your needs and extend in its functionality. From the first moment on i knew i wanted it to be modular and flexible. My first thought on a solution was to create this as something like "Webmin" - a http server to provice access to the underlying operating system. I do not intend to reenvent the wheel. But the wheel certainly needs a new layer to make it roll smoother on any surface. That beeing said, you know what it is about. The Name "werksattpy" is mix of "Werkstatt" (the german word f√ºr workshop) and "PYthon".
It is a fitting name, since it resembles the DIY philosophie with hands on work, the creativity and that things will be customizable and fixable. Plus it gives a good indicator for a naming_scheme of the scripts which will be part of this. Like "Door" for a point of entry or "wrench" for a compressing tool or "Toolbox" for a specic task or workflow, where "Toolbox DEV" could be a Subset of all tools in a folder, which are related to Developing Applications.

I dont know where this will lead, but

LETS ROCK!

Contributions welcome!

PS: Check out "bimpy". ;)

(()) I AM A NOOB - So pleasse read my stuff having that in mind and perhaps some of you may be smiling while reading and remembering their first "hello world" and how far they have gotten now. i will try to keep this updated and as a "travellers journal". perhaps it will help others, to get started a little bit quicker. If you are new to coding in general, let me tell you a secret that will spare you a lot of hassle. there is no such thing as "fast, easy and for free". but i will try to get as close to it as possible. 
A setup to make your life a lot easier from the beginning on is to use github desktop, atom as editor and install kite right away. It also is a good idea to have one single folder which will contain all your stuff related to coding. This should contain at least the folders "../backup" "../backup/now", "../backup/last", "../backup/previous", "testing", "dev" and "live or stable". this can be used for an automated backup script. I will provide a sample in a zip-file. This will include the above folderstructure and a simple script. the same thing will be used in werkstattpy.  (())
